I’m an engineer and a self-taught graphic designer living in Bangalore. I also write about electronics (mostly processors), motorcycles, cars, cybersecurity, and cricket. I co-created The Boring Magazine, Gradiento, Internet Of Bings, The Circuit Breakers, 657th Studio, Nil 5tudio (sadly all of them are defunct A/O ’21). I speak in English, Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Spanish, and code in JS, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python.
